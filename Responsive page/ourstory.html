<div class="main"><p class="p">Medium is a home for human stories and ideas. Here, anyone can share knowledge and wisdom with the world—without having to build a mailing list or a following first. The internet is noisy and chaotic; Medium is quiet yet full of insight. It’s simple, beautiful, collaborative, and helps you find the right readers for whatever you have to say.
</p>
<p class="pp">
Ultimately, our goal is to deepen our collective understanding of the world through the power of writing.</p>
<p class="ppp">Over 100 million people connect and share their wisdom on Medium every month. They’re software developers, amateur novelists, product designers, CEOs, and anyone burning with a story they need to get out into the world. They write about what they’re working on, what’s keeping them up at night, what they’ve lived through, and what they’ve learned that the rest of us might want to know too.

</p>
<p class="p">Instead of selling ads or selling your data, we’re supported by a growing community of over a million Medium members who believe in our mission. If you’re new here, start reading. Dive deeper into whatever matters to you. Find a post that helps you learn something new, or reconsider something familiar—and then write your story.</p>
